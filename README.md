# Modpack-Launcher
A minimal modpack launcher for Minecraft.

This application automatically keeps a minecraft modpack up to date and keeps an installation seperate from the main Minecraft folder in AppData.

It's designed to run quickly and be very minimal, instead of being very complex and annoying to navigate through and taking a long time to load like most modpack launchers.
